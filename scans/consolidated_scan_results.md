**Risk:** Medium
**Name:** Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.
**Solution:** Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

**Risk:** Informational
**Name:** Charset Mismatch (Header Versus Meta Content-Type Charset)
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.

An attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice. For example, if an attacker can control content at the beginning of the page, they could inject script using UTF-7 encoded text and manipulate some browsers into interpreting that text.
**Solution:** Force UTF-8 for all text content in both the HTTP header and meta tags in HTML or encoding declarations in XML.
**Reference:** https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Character_set_handling_and_detection

**Risk:** Medium
**Name:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
**Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

**Risk:** Low
**Name:** Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.
**Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details.

---
**Risk:** Low
**Name:** X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
**Solution:** Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

**Risk:** Low
**Name:** Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s)
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.
**Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress "X-Powered-By" headers.

# ZAP Scan Results
**Risk:** Medium
**Name:** Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.
**Solution:** Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.
**Reference:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options
---
**Risk:** Informational
**Name:** Charset Mismatch (Header Versus Meta Content-Type Charset)
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there's a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content's correct character set.

An attacker could manipulate content on the page to be interpreted in an encoding of their choice. For example, if an attacker can control content at the beginning of the page, they could inject script using UTF-7 encoded text and manipulate some browsers into interpreting that text.
**Solution:** Force UTF-8 for all text content in both the HTTP header and meta tags in HTML or encoding declarations in XML.
**Reference:** https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Character_set_handling_and_detection
---
**Risk:** Medium
**Name:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page â€” covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
**Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.
**Reference:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy
https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html

**Risk:** Low
**Name:** Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.
**Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details.
**Reference:** https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#servertokens

https://www.troyhunt.com/shhh-dont-let-your-response-headers/
---
**Risk:** Low
**Name:** X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
**Solution:** Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

---
**Risk:** Low
**Name:** Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s)
**URL:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
**Description:** The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.
**Solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress "X-Powered-By" headers.
